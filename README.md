## Requirements

### Game Version
**Mages & Vikings** requires the **Skyrim Anniversary Edition** with all Creation Club content. The modlist is built for the **1.5.97 version** of the game, utilizing the _Best of Both Worlds_ patcher to integrate the additional content from version **1.6.1170**.

### System Requirements
This modlist is optimized for performance without sacrificing visual quality. While most textures are 2K (and 1K where appropriate), **Mages & Vikings** prioritizes stunning visuals with dense forests, realistic grass, and full ENB effects. 

To fully enjoy this experience, the following hardware is recommended:
- **GPU**: RTX 4070 or higher
- **RAM**: 32GB
- **CPU**: A modern, high-performance processor

>[!TIP]
>Another recommendation is to use [Lossless Scaling](https://store.steampowered.com/app/993090/Lossless_Scaling/), which employs machine learning for scaling and frame generation, offering a smoother experience.
